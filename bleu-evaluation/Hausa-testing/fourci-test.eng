{b>FOURCi’s CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE FOR RURAL WOMEN<b}
Women are experiencing increased responsibilities and workloads, especially as they are returning to their homes after the insurgency experienced in the northeast.
{b>Concern on climate Change for the Community Initiative (FOURCi) <b}continues to find more ways to support women’s agriculture activities that will overcome the gender gap in productivity and promote gender equality for the benefits of their communities and society, while also understanding the critical role women play in mitigating and adapting to climate change.
This guide is aimed to assist rural women making composts and do backyard gardening to enable them produce nutritious fruits and vegetables to supplement their nutritional needs and that of their children.
{bi>COMPOST MAKING GUIDE AND BACKYARD GARDENING<bi}
Composting is when food and plant waste material decomposes biologically.
There are three main types of composting methods, aerobic (with oxygen), anaerobic (without oxygen) and vermicompost (using worms instead of bacteria).
Composting is nature’s process of recycling.
Composting biodegrades organic waste into a rich soil known as compost.
Composting is done by billions of microbes (bacteria, fungi) that digest the kitchen waste and turn it into compost.
The aim of composting is to provide cheap and an environmentally safe form of adding manure to the garden which also ensures healthy food.
By composting we can also reduce the amount of garbage we needlessly send to the landfills for disposal.
It keeps our city clean, preserves the soil, prevents air pollution and makes this earth a better place to live.
Nearly 60% or more of the daily waste generated in our households is made up of organic matter which can be easily converted into compost.
{b>Segregate your household waste.<b}
The first step to composting is segregation of waste.
You will need two dustbins.
One is for biodegradable materials (vegetable, fruit scraps, peels, egg shells, coffee grounds etc and other organic matters) and the other one is for non-biodegradable or toxic waste (polyethene bags (leather)glass, plastic, medicines, wrappers, used batteries etc).
I recycle newspapers, milk covers, plastic cans and glass bottles.
{b>Tips<b} – You can have a green dustbin for organic waste and red one for toxic waste.
{b>What to compost?<b}
{b>How to compost?<b}
Composting is done by billions of microbes (bacteria, fungi) that digest the kitchen waste and turn it into compost.
These composting microorganisms require the correct proportion of Carbon and Nitrogen for it to do its work.
{b>High nitrogen materials include.<b}
Vegetable and fruit peels and scraps (except citrus fruits)
Coffee grounds
Tea bags
Flowers
Egg shells (has to be crushed before adding)
{b>High carbon<b}
Dry leaves
Saw dust
Small wood chips
Straw or hay
Wood ash
{b>What not to add<b}
Cooked food as it decays and gives a bad smell, so it is best to avoid adding it.
Meat, bones as it attracts rats and smells bad
Pet waste
Batteries
Diseased plants
Medicines
Plastic bags
{b>How to compost using a plastic bucket or a pot.<b}
You will need any old plastic bucket or terracotta pot.
Kitchen waste and dry leaves (greens and browns).
The first step is to drill two or even three rows of holes on the sides and some holes on the bottom of the bucket.
Let us name this{bu> Bucket A<bu}.
Keep the bucket raised off the surface so that air can circulate underneath.
This will ensure aeration and proper drainage of water.
Keep a tray at the bottom of the bucket to collect the water discharged during decomposition.
It can be diluted and added to plants.
{u>Preparing the bucket post for composting<u}
Line the bottom of the bucket with a layer of soil.
Now add your kitchen waste (green matter) and cover it with saw dust or dry leaves (brown matter).
Add a little cow dung to start off the decomposition process.
Keep it covered to prevent smell and to keep off insects.
You can use any old wooden board or anything to cover it.
Mix the pile once or twice a week for aeration.
If you find the pile dry, sprinkle some water and mix it well.
If it is soggy, add more dry leaves or saw dust and give a good mix.
Make sure the pile is damp.
It should not be too dry nor too wet.
Keep adding a mix of greens and browns every day until bucket{b> A<b} is full.
While Bucket A is preparing the compost, you can use another bucket (let us name it Bucket B) and repeat the same process above.
Make sure to stir both Bucket A and B twice a week.
You can have a Bucket C for storing almost done compost.
It will take 45-60 days to fully compost depending on the temperature.
{b>Composting by digging a pit.<b}
If you have space in your garden or backyard, dig a small pit and follow the same process above.
Keep the pit covered to keep away pests.
The same rule mentioned under “maintenance for any compost bin” applies for this also.
You must maintain the correct moisture level, turn the pile for aeration, add a mix of browns and greens.
You can add cow dung to start the decomposition process.
{b>BACKYARD GARDENING<b}
This is a general guide for all fruits ad vegetable as we encourage the women to use the local techniques that is used in their environment and will be support with technical support for FOURCi’s Climate Smart Agriculture experts in the field.
The steps include:
{b>1.<b}
{b>The women are expected to first decide what type of fruit or vegetable to cultivate depending on location, availability, climatic condition etc.<b}
{1>2.<1}
{1>Choose the proper seed to cultivate<1}.
With advice from our experts, the a variety of seed that is disease resistant, easy to manage, weed resistant and will produce high yield.
{1>3.<1}
{1>Nursery preparation.<1}
The next step is to prepare the nursery so that the seeds can germinate.
You can either choose to raise nursery on beds in the garden or plant indoors.
When the seeds begin to germinate and grow leaves and roots, you can transplant them to areas suitable for growth and production.
{1>4.<1}
{1>Site selection and land preparation<1}
Choose a sunny place because the warmer the soil, the faster the most vegetables and fruits  grow.
The soil should be well drained and not soaked.
Loosen the soil to at least 20 cm depth.
Finally, it’s time to transplant or plant the seedlings.
{1>5.<1}
{1>Wetting your fruit or vegetable<1}
Water is crucial in fruits and vegetable farming so, access to it is necessary.
Your garden must have a ready and steady source of water.
So, it’s good if you have a well or other source of water nearby, relying on rain fed gardening is long outdated.
Smart farmers now farm all year round with drip irrigation systems.
{1>6.<1}
{1>Protecting your plants and weeding<1}
It is very important you protect your plants from diseases, hence weeding should be done when necessary and regularly.
Avoid the use of pesticides and weedicides as much as possible because they contaminate the environment and are harmful.
{1>7.<1}
{1>Staking<1}
Some fruits such as tomatoes and melons require staking, staking should be done where necessary with advice from our experts.
{1>9.<1}
{1>Compost application<1}
Compost should be applied to increase the nutrient of the soil for high yield productivity.
Artificial or synthetic fertilizers should be avoided.
{1>10.<1}
{1>Harvesting <1}
When the fruits or vegetables are ready, they can be harvested, consumed or  either stored or sold.
{b>KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS FOR USE IN CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION AND SENSITIZATION IN SCHOOLS.<b}
{b>Climate<b}:
Refers to a long-term atmospheric weather condition of a specific geographic region (which ranges from years to decades).
{b>Weather<b}:
Refers to the atmospheric condition of a region over a short period of time.
{b>Climate Change:<b}
This refers to a long-term shift in temperatures and weather patterns.
These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, Human activities have been the main drivers of climate change primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels which produces heat trapping gases.
{b>Temperature<b}:
This is the measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a place.
The instrument used in measuring temperature is called THERMOMETER.
{b>Humidity<b}:
This is the amount of water vapor in the air.
The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside.
{b>Water Vapor<b}:
This is the gaseous state of water that is generally invisible to the eye.
{b>Precipitation<b}:
Is water released from clouds in the form of rain, snow or hail.
Most precipitation falls as rain.
{b>Greenhouse Effect:<b}
This is the way through which heat is trapped to the earth’s surface by the greenhouse gases.
{b>Greenhouse Gas:<b}
This is the gas that emits radiant energy.
The primary greenhouse gases on Earth’s surface are CO2, CH4, N2O and ozone.
{b>CLIMATE INDICATORS<b}
These are set of parameters that describe the state of the climate.
These indicators have been identified by scientists.
The global climate system is complex.
In order to unpack these complexities, there are indicators used to describe the changing climate.
They include: temperature,  greenhouse gases,  ocean heat / ocean acidification, sea ice etc.
{b>Greenhouse Gases:<b}
Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities are a major driver of climate change.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most addressed greenhouse gas.
Burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas is adding CO2 to the atmosphere.
Other gases include methane and nitrous oxide.
The major cause of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases leading to the fast warming up of the world.
Manufacturing and Mining Industries produces emissions mostly from burning fossil fuel to produce energy for production of industrial materials.
Deforestation causes emissions.
Destroying forests limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.
Most cars, lorries, ships and planes run on fossil fuels which makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases especially CO2 emissions.
Since the industrial revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius.
Between 1880 and 1980, it rose by 0.07 degree Celsius every 10 years.
Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has doubled; in the past 40 years, we have seen the global temperature rise by 0.18 degree Celsius per decade.
As a result, the planet has never been hotter.
Nine of the 10 warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005- and the 5 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015.
Now Climate Change scientist have concluded that we must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 if we are to avoid a future in which everyday life around the world is marked by its worst, most devastating effects; the extreme floods, wildfires, floods, tropical storms and other disasters.
Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that would have bounced off the earth’s surface.
They trap the heat and make the earth hotter.
The other heat trapping pollutants include.
Methane
Nitrous oxide
Water vapor
Synthetic fluorinated gases{1>.<1}
{b>They are collectively called GREEN HOUSE GASES and their impact is called the GREENHOUSE EFFECT.<b}
{b>EFFECTS OF Global Warming<b}
Disappearing Glacers (ice).
Rising sea levels (warmer and more acidic oceans).
Infestation of new pests.
Heat waves.
Increased flooding.
Animals and plant species are going into extinction.
Infectious disease outbreaks.
{b>Climate Change Mitigation<b} refers to efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases.
Mitigation can mean using new technologies and renewable energies, changing management practices or consumer behavior.
Cutting carbon is the only long-term solution for avoiding climate impacts.
Other mitigation strategies are adopting renewable energy sources like solar and wind, development of more sustainable transport systems, promoting sustainable uses of land through afforestation and implementing climate-smart agriculture.
{b>Addressing the issue of climate change requires the involvement of people and organizations at all levels and that is why FOURCI comes into play.<b}
{b>SOME SIMPLE THINGS STUDENTS CAN DO TO HELP PROTECT THE EARTH<b}
Reduce, reuse, and recycle.
Cut down on what you throw away.
Follow the three “R’s” to conserve natural resources and landfill space.
Volunteer:
Volunteer for cleanups in your community.
You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too.
Educate:
When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and value of our natural resources.
Conserve water:
The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually ends up in the ocean.
Shop wisely, buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.
Use long-lasting light bulbs.
Energy efficient light bulbs reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Plant a tree.
Trees provide food and oxygen.
They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate change. (they are carbon sinks)
